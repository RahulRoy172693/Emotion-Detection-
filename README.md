# Emotion Detection from Images using Deep Learning

This project implements an emotion detection system using deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras. The model takes an image of a face as input and predicts the corresponding emotion such as
happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Image-based emotion classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Trained on publicly available datasets Train.zip 
- Built with TensorFlow and Keras
- Inspired by online tutorials and resources
